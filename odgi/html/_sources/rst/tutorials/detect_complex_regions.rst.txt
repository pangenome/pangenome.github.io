Synopsis
========

Human chromosomes have large regions of highly identical repeats. They can be found in as clusters centromeres,
regions of segmental duplication, or in the acrocentric short arms of chromosomes.
`Logsdon et al., Nature 2021 <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03420-7>`__ showed that chromosome 8 carries a modestly sized
centromere of approximately 1.5–2.2 Mb, in which AT-rich, 171-base-pair (bp) α-satellite
repeats are organized into a well-defined higher-order repeat (HOR) array. ``odgi`` offers tools to detect and explore
such regions.

Steps
=====

--------------------------
Get the Human chr8 dataset
--------------------------

Download the pangenome graph of the `Human chromosome 8 <https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/human-pangenomics/pangenomes/scratch/2021_05_06_pggb/gfas/chr8.pan.gfa.gz>`_
in ``GFA`` format, decompress it, and convert it to a graph in ``odgi`` format:

.. code-block:: bash

    wget -c https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/human-pangenomics/pangenomes/scratch/2021_05_06_pggb/gfas/chr8.pan.gfa.gz
    gunzip chr8.pan.gfa.gz

    odgi build -g chr8.pan.gfa -o chr8.pan.og --threads 2 -P

The last command creates a file called ``chr8.pan.og``, which contains the input graph in ``odgi`` format. This graph contains
the contigs of 88 haploid, phased human genome assemblies from 44 individuals, plus the chm13 and GRCh38 reference genomes.

-----------------------------------
Obtain the depth over the pangenome
-----------------------------------

To identify the repetitive sequences, we can analyze the **depth** in the graph. Here we define as **node depth** the
number of times in which the node is crossed by all the paths present in the graph.

To obtain the depth over the pangenome graph, execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    odgi depth -i chr8.pan.og -r chm13#chr8 | \
        bedtools makewindows -b /dev/stdin -w 5000 > chm13.chr8.w5kbps.bed

    odgi depth -i chr8.pan.og -b chm13.chr8.w5kbps.bed --threads 2 | \
        bedtools sort > chr8.pan.depth.w5kbps.bed

The ``chm13.chr8.w5kbps.bed`` file contains 5000 bps interval windows across the chm13 reference chromosome 8. The depth
is computed for each of these windows, writing the result in the ``chr8.pan.depth.w5kbps.bed`` file, in ``BED`` format.
``-r`` specifies the path name from which to compute the depth from. ``-b`` specifies the BED ranges of which the
depths should be calculated of.

.. note::

    It will take a while to obtain the depth over all the windows. You can find the gzipped result in the ``test`` folder
    in the root of the ``odgi`` project, in the ``chr8.pan.depth.w5kbps.bed.gz`` file. Gunzip the file before using it.

Take a look at the first rows of the ``chr8.pan.depth.w5kbps.bed`` file:

.. code-block:: bash

    head chr8.pan.depth.w5kbps.bed -n 5 | column -t

.. code-block:: none

    chm13#chr8  0      5000   60.1014
    chm13#chr8  5000   10000  89.5402
    chm13#chr8  10000  15000  91.1302
    chm13#chr8  15000  20000  90.0506
    chm13#chr8  20000  25000  94.0238

The 4-th column indicates the ``mean depth`` of each window. For each node within a window, the product between the node
depth and its length (in bp) is calculated. The overall total sum is divided by the length of the window (in bp). This
results in the ``mean depth``.

---------------------------------------------------
The centromere's Higher-Order Repeat (HOR) organization
---------------------------------------------------

The chromosome 8 centromeric HOR array is primarily composed of four distinct HOR types represented by 4, 7, 8 or
11 α-satellite monomer cassettes. Thankfully, `Logsdon et al., Nature 2021 <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03420-7>`_ provide HOR
annotations (you can find them in the ``test`` folder in the root of the ``odgi`` project, in the ``chr8_HORarray_organization.colors.bed``
file), so we can take a closer look at the centromere:

.. image:: /img/chr8_HOR.mean_depth.2.png

``Mean depth`` of the chromosome 8 centromeric HOR array. Every letter indicates an alpha-satellite monomer in the HOR (so, ``A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K``
would indicate an HOR with 11 alpha-satellite monomers). The ``mean depth`` drop falls into the hypomethylated and CENP-A-enriched regions, that have the highest consistent
entropy in the entire array. This is in concordance with the `Logsdon et al., Nature 2021 <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03420-7>`_
publication, see the figure below. The drop in the depth may indicate hypervariability between genomes in the transition from methylated
to unmethylated DNA, or that the region is not alignable.
