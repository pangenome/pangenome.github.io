Translate path positions between graphs
#######################################

Translate path positions between graphs (odgi position application): we use that to go from a smoothed graph to a
consensus graph and vice versa, but we need a more general example of 2 graphs (from different runs, for example).

NOTE:
- two graphs with different genomes in them except for the reference
- two studies make graphs
- they are different, but good individually
- now let's compare them... I have a variant in some gene I'm interested in in one
- where is that in the other graph? what paths are there?
- let's pull out the region in both graphs and visualize them


1) Download 2 GFAs from here (?????? and ??????)
2) odgi build + odgi build

A) GENERAL EXAMPLE: we need 2 graphs to show a general case (from different runs, for example)
3) ...

B) SPECIFIC PGGB EXAMPLE: from consensus graph to smoothed graph
odgi is used in productin in pggb (link). Very little explanation, and then explain
4) consensus->smoothed
5 NOT SURE) smoothed->consensus
