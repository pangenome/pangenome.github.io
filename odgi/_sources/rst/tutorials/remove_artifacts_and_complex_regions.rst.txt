Remove artifacts and complex regions

Synopsis
========

`De novo` assemblies may present errors (mis-assembled sequences, e.g., misjoins and erroneous insertions/deletions) or
sequences that are difficult to align (e.g., centromeres). These issues lead to pangenome graphs with artifacts and/or
very complex regions. To make the downstream analyses easier, for e.g. read mapping against the graph or graph visualization,
pangenome graphs can be simplified by applying a set of ``odgi`` tools.

.. This pangenome was generated with the following command line:
.. pggb -t 48 -i chr8.pan.fa -p 98 -s 100000 -n 90 -k 29 -B 10000000 -w 1000000 -G 5000 -v -L -o chr8.pan -Z
.. pggb -> /gnu/store/bhbh7rc3gza4jmvc09q9dihmm6b4m8jl-pggb-0.1.0+9209280-6/bin/pggb

--------------------------
Get the Human chr8 dataset
--------------------------

Download the pangenome graph of the `Human chromosome 8 <https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/human-pangenomics/pangenomes/scratch/2021_05_06_pggb/gfas/chr8.pan.gfa.gz>`_
in ``GFA`` format, decompress it, and convert it to a graph in ``odgi`` format:

.. code-block:: bash

    wget -c https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/human-pangenomics/pangenomes/scratch/2021_05_06_pggb/gfas/chr8.pan.gfa.gz
    gunzip chr8.pan.gfa.gz

    odgi build -g chr8.pan.gfa -o chr8.pan.og --threads 2 -P

The last command creates a file called ``chr8.pan.og``, which contains the input graph in ``odgi`` format. This graph contains contigs of
88 haploid, phased human genome assemblies from 44 individuals, plus the chm13 and GRCh38 reference genomes.

----------------------------
Identify problematic regions
----------------------------

The **depth** is a good metric to identify problematic regions in a pangenome graph. Here we define as **node depth**
the number of times in which the node is crossed by all the paths present in the graph.

Low depth regions in the pangenome graph can be artifacts. To identify them, execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    odgi depth -i chr8.pan.og -w 100:0:1 > chr8.pan.low_depth.bed

The ``chr8.pan.low_depth.bed`` file reports the regions where the node depth is between 0x and 1x. Regions closer to
100 bp have been merged into a single region. The file is in ``BED`` format. ``-w 100:0:1`` selects a window size of
100 bp where the depth must be within **0** and **1**.

High depth regions in the pangenome graph can indicate complex regions. To identify them, execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    odgi depth -i chr8.pan.og -w 100000:5000:100000000 > chr8.pan.high_depth.bed

The ``chr8.pan.high_depth.bed`` file reports the regions where the node depth is between 5000x and 100000000x. Regions
closer to 100000 bp have been merged into a single region. The file is in ``BED`` format.

If the extracted regions are too short, the cleaned graphs can become too fragmented. To avoid this, filter out all regions shorter than
or equal to 10000 bps, merging the adjacent ranges:

.. code-block:: bash

    (awk '$3 - $2 > '10000 chr8.pan.low_depth.bed ; \
        awk '$3 - $2 > '100000 chr8.pan.high_depth.bed ) | \
        bedtools sort | bedtools merge > chr8.pan.regions_to_remove.bed

The ``chr8.pan.regions_to_remove.bed`` file contains all the regions to remove.

-----------------------------
Remove the identified regions
-----------------------------

To clean the pangenome graph, execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    odgi paths -i chr8.pan.og -L | grep '^grch38#chr8' > chr8.pan.path_to_fully_retain.txt

    odgi extract -i chr8.pan.og --threads 2 -P \
         --inverse \
         -b chr8.pan.regions_to_remove.bed \
         -R chr8.pan.path_to_fully_retain.txt \
         -o chr8.pan.clean.og

The ``path_to_fully_retain.txt`` contains the name of the reference genome to fully retain in the resulting graph. This
is necessary to be able to use the reference coordinate system in the cleaned graph. Moreover, keeping a full genome help
to avoid breaking the pangenome graph in complex regions like the centromere.

The ``--inverse`` flag specifies that the regions in the ``regions_to_remove.bed`` file are the regions to remove from the graph.

The resulting graphs presents several connected components:

.. code-block:: bash

    odgi stats -i chr8.pan.clean.og -W | head -n 1

.. code-block:: none

    ##num_weakly_connected_components: 24583

This is due to `de novo` assembly artifacts, under-alignments, and/or complex regions to align. Nevertheless, the clean
version of the input graph can be found in its biggest connected component. To obtain it, execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    odgi explode -i chr8.pan.clean.og -p chr8.pan.clean.exp -b 1 -s P -O

The command creates a file called ``chr8.pan.clean.exp.8.og``, which contains the biggest connected component
(the number 8 in this example) in ``odgi`` format. The ``-s P`` option specifies to consider as biggest component the
one with the longer path. ``-b`` selects the number of biggest components to retain.

-------------------
Display graph stats
-------------------

To have basic information on the cleaned graph, execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    odgi stats -i chr8.pan.clean.exp.8.og -S | column -t

.. code-block:: none

    #length    nodes    edges    paths
    149046153  4044095  5600776  65354

---------------------------
Generate a 1D visualization
---------------------------

To visualize the cleaned graph, first sort it:

.. code-block:: bash

    odgi sort -p Y -i chr8.pan.clean.exp.8.og -o chr8.pan.clean.sort.og -P

And then execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    odgi paths -i chr8.pan.og -L | cut -f 1,2 -d '#' | uniq > chr8.pan.haplotype_names.txt

    odgi viz -i chr8.pan.clean.sort.og -x 1000 -o chr8.pan.clean.sort.png -M chr8.pan.haplotype_names.txt

The ``haplotype_names.txt`` file contains all the haplotypes present in the input assembly. They are necessary to
merge the paths belonging to the same haplotype in the same row in the image.

We obtain the following PNG image:

.. image:: /img/chr8.pan.clean.sort.png

The 1-Dimensional visualization shows that all centromeres have been removed. Indeed, they present high depth being
very complex regions. Only the GRCh38 reference centromere is present because it was explicitly preserved during the
removal step of the low and high depth regions.

Moreover, for two haplotypes (``HG01071#2`` and ``HG03098#1``), a region close to their centromere is erroneously absent.
This may be due to under-alignment: this leads to the generation of low depth nodes in the pangenome graph, which would
be removed during the removal step.
