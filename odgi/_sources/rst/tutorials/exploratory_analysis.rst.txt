Synopsis
========

Visualizing pangenome graphs we can gain insight into the mutual relationship between the embedded genomes and their
variation. However, complex, nonlinear graph structures are difficult to present in a convenient number of dimensions.
:ref:`odgi viz` offers a binned, linearized 1-Dimensional rendering. It is able to display gigabase scale pangenomes,
and several visualization modalities to grasp the complexity in the graphs.

=====
Steps
=====

-------------------------
Build the DRB1-3123 graph
-------------------------

Assuming that your current working directory is the root of the ``odgi`` project, to construct an ``odgi`` file from the
``DRB1-3123`` dataset in ``GFA`` format, execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    odgi build -g test/DRB1-3123.gfa -o DRB1-3123.og

The command creates a file called ``DRB1-3123.og``, which contains the input graph in ``odgi`` format. This graph contains
12 ALT sequences of the `HLA-DRB1 gene <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3123>`_ from the GRCh38 reference genome.

-----------------------------
Visualize the DRB1-3123 graph
-----------------------------

To visualize the graph, execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    odgi viz -i DRB1-3123.og -o DRB1-3123.png -x 500

To obtain the following PNG image:

.. image:: /img/DRB1-3123.png

In this 1-Dimensional visualization:

- The graph nodes are arranged from left to right, forming the ``pangenome sequence``.
- The colored bars represent the the paths versus the ``pangenome sequences`` in a binary matrix.
- The path names are visualized on the left.
- The black lines under the paths are the links, which represent the graph topology.

See :ref:`odgi viz` documentation for more information.

---------------------------------------
Color with respect to the node position
---------------------------------------

This is a linearized visualization, but the pangenome graphs are not linear when the embedded genomes present structural
variation. However, a graph can be optimized for being better visualized in 1-Dimension by sorting its nodes properly
(see the :ref:`sorting-layouting` tutorial for more information).

To color the bars with respect to the node position in each path, execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    odgi viz -i DRB1-3123.og -o DRB1-3123.du.png -x 500 -d -u

To obtain the following PNG image:

.. image:: /img/DRB1-3123.du.png

For each path, the brightness goes from light (for the starting position) to black (for the ending position). A linear
genome in a well-sorted graph appears with a smooth brightness gradient in this visualization modality. ``-d`` changes
the color darkness based on the nucleotide position in the path. ``-u`` sets the color darkness range from white for
the first nucleotide position of a path to black for the last nucleotide position of a path.

Interestingly, the ``>gi|345525392:5000-18402`` path has a brightness gradient which go from right to left. DNA sequence
graphs have two strands, with the node implicitly representing both strands. That gradient indicates that the path is
reversed with respect to the ``pangenome sequence``.

-------------------------------------------
Color with respect to the node strandedness
-------------------------------------------

To color the bars with respect to the strandedness that each node has in each path, execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    odgi viz -i DRB1-3123.og -o DRB1-3123.z.png -x 500 -z

to obtain the following PNG image:

.. image:: /img/DRB1-3123.z.png

``-z`` changes the color palette to respect the node strandedness. Black is forward, red is reverse.
The red bar in a path indicates that that region is inverted in that path with respect to the ``pangenome sequence``.

-----------------------------
Build the Lipoprotein A graph
-----------------------------

Assuming that your current working directory is the root of the ``odgi`` project, to construct an ``odgi`` file from the
``LPA`` dataset in ``GFA`` format, execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    odgi build -g test/LPA.gfa -o LPA.og

The command creates a file called ``LPA.og``, which contains the input graph in ``odgi`` format. This graph contains
13 contigs from 7 haploid human genome assemblies from 6 individuals plus the chm13 cell line. The contigs cover the
`Lipoprotein A (LPA) <https://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Summary?g=ENSG00000198670>`_ locus, which encodes the
Apo(a) protein.

-----------------------
Visualize the LPA graph
-----------------------

To visualize the graph, execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    odgi viz -i LPA.og -o LPA.b.png -x 500 -b

To obtain the following PNG image:

.. image:: /img/LPA.b.png

----------------------------------------------
Color with respect to the node depth in a path
----------------------------------------------

Eukaryotic genomes are characterized by repetitive sequences. These sequences can lead to complex regions in the pangenome
graphs. To identify them, we can analyze the **depth** in the graph. Here we define **node depth in a path** as the number
of times the node is crossed by a path.

To color the bars with respect to the mean `depth`, execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    odgi viz -i LPA.og -o LPA.bm.png -x 500 -bm

To obtain the following PNG image:

.. image:: /img/LPA.bm.png

Low depth regions are black, while high depth regions are colored green. Apo(a) proteins vary in size due to a size
polymorphism, the KIV-2 variable numbers of tandem repeats (VNTRs). The VNTR region in the LPA pangenome presents high
**depth**, that becomes evident as a light green stripe in the image. ``-b`` explicitly forces ``odgi viz`` to bin the
graph before visualizing it. ``-m`` changes the color palette to display the mean depth per bin as a shade of green.

-----------------------------
Visualize a particular region
-----------------------------

To obtain the coordinates of the VNTRs, execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    odgi depth -i LPA.og -r chm13__LPA__tig00000001| \
        bedtools makewindows -b /dev/stdin -w 5000 > chm13__LPA__tig00000001.w5kbps.bed

    odgi depth -i LPA.og -b chm13__LPA__tig00000001.w5kbps.bed | \
        bedtools sort > chm13__LPA__tig00000001.depth.w5kbps.bed

    awk -F"\t" '$4 > 20.0' chm13__LPA__tig00000001.depth.w5kbps.bed | \
        bedtools merge

.. code-block:: none

    chm13__LPA__tig00000001 140000  275000

The ``chm13__LPA__tig00000001.w5kbps.bed`` file contains 5000 bp interval windows across the chm13__LPA__tig00000001
contig. The depth is computed for each of these windows, writing the result in the
``chm13__LPA__tig00000001.depth.w5kbps.bed`` file, in ``BED`` format. ``-r`` specifies the path name from which to
compute the depth from. ``-b`` specifies the BED ranges of which the depths should be calculated of.

To visualize the identified region, execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    odgi viz -i LPA.og -o LPA.bm.VNTRs.png -x 500 -bm -r chm13__LPA__tig00000001:140000-275000

To obtain the following PNG image:

.. image:: /img/LPA.bm.VNTRs.png
