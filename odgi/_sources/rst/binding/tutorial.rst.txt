Creating Graphs
****************
Let's say that you wanted to create the following graph with ODGI:

.. image:: /img/exampleGraph.png

This graph is a combination of nodes (labelled as `n0`, `n1`, ..., `n9`) and directed edges (arrows).

ODGI Objects
=============

*Edges* and *nodes* are accessed through a :class:`odgi.graph` object.  Individual nodes in the graph are pointed at by :class:`odgi.handle`.

Paths in the graph and accessed through :class:`odgi.path_handle`, which is a series of :class:`odgi.step_handle` linked together.  Each :class:`odgi.step_handle` is points to the node in that step, and also contains directional information regarding the nodes preceeding and following it.

Handles are pointers to specific pieces of the graph, and it is not possible to operate on them directly, aside from comparing whether the objects are equal.  To get information regarding the object that each handle is pointing to, it is necessary to use the corresponding `get` accessor method in :class:`odgi.graph`.

Reference materials for these methods can be found at the :ref:`api`, as well as the :ref:`glossary`, which contains lists sorted by object type for :ref:`accessor`, :ref:`mutator`, and :ref:`iterator`.

Making a Graph
===============
First, we must create the graph, then make each node and keep track of their handles.

.. code-block:: python

        gr = odgi.graph()
        seq = ["CGA", "TTGG", "CCGT", "C", "GT", "GATAA", "CGG", "ACA", "GCCG", "ATATAAC"]
        n = []
        for s in seq:
                n.append(gr.create_handle(s))

Now we link together these nodes using their handles. Note that each of these handles is directional, so in order to create the bidirectional edge between `n5` and `n8` we use ``create_edge`` twice.

.. code-block:: python

        gr.create_edge(n[0], n[1])
        gr.create_edge(n[1], n[2])
        gr.create_edge(n[2], n[3])
        gr.create_edge(n[2], n[4])
        gr.create_edge(n[3], n[5])
        gr.create_edge(n[5], n[6])
        gr.create_edge(n[5], n[8])
        gr.create_edge(n[6], n[7])
        gr.create_edge(n[6], n[8])
        gr.create_edge(n[7], n[9])
        gr.create_edge(n[8], n[9])
        gr.create_edge(n[8], n[5])

Traversing Edges
================
If we wanted to traverse these edges, we could do it using the iterator method :func:`odgi.graph.follow_edges`.

.. code-block:: python

        def next_node_list(handle):
                lis = []
                gr.follow_edges(handle, False, lambda y: lis.append(y))
                return lis
        
        print(f'n0: {gr.get_sequence(n[0])}')
        next_node = next_node_list(n[0])[0]
        print(f'n1: {gr.get_sequence(next_node)}')
        next_node = next_node_list(next_node)[0]
        print(f'n2: {gr.get_sequence(next_node)}')

Which will output the following:

.. code-block::
        
        n0: CGA
        n1: TTGG
        n2: CCGT

A map of the data can be generated using :func:`odgi.graph.to_gfa`.

.. code-block:: python

        print(gr.to_gfa())

Creating a Path
===============

Generating a linear sequence from this graph could be done in infinitely many ways, due to the interal loop between `n5`, `n6`, and `n8`.  If we wanted to define a single consensus sequence, we would do this by defining a path.

.. image:: /img/exampleGraphPath.png

To create the hilighted path, we would need to create a :class:`odgi.path_handle` in the graph, and then append each :class:`odgi.handle` to the end of the path.

.. code-block:: python

        path = gr.create_path_handle("path")
        gr.append_step(path, n[0])
        gr.append_step(path, n[1])
        gr.append_step(path, n[2])
        gr.append_step(path, n[4])
        gr.append_step(path, n[5])
        gr.append_step(path, n[6])
        gr.append_step(path, n[7])
        gr.append_step(path, n[9])

.. warning::

        :func:`odgi.graph.append_step` will not stop you from appending nodes that are not connected to the preceeding node.

.. code-block:: python
        
        # the following code runs without error
        badpath = gr.create_path_handle("badpath")
        gr.append_step(badpath, n[0])
        gr.append_step(badpath, n[3])

Traversing a path
=================

To traverse a path, we need to fetch a series of :class:`odgi.step_handle` from the graph. Note that although we are effectively asking the path for these items in it, all accessor methods are a part of the :class:`odgi.graph` object.

.. code-block:: python

        step = gr.path_begin(path)
        while(gr.has_next_step(step)):
                # get the node handle from the step handle
                current_node_handle = gr.get_handle_of_step(step)
                # ask the node handle for the sequence
                print(gr.get_sequence(current_node_handle))
                # progress to the next step
                step = gr.get_next_step(step)
        current_node_handle = gr.get_handle_of_step(step)
        print(gr.get_sequence(current_node_handle))

Which will output the following:

.. code-block:: 
        
        CGA
        TTGG
        CCGT
        GT
        GATAA
        CGG
        ACA
        ATATAAC

        commenting out this section because path manipulation doesn't seem to work right now
        Manipulating a path
        ===================
        .. DANGER::
                Right now none of this works, because insert_step seems to cause a memory leak. 
        
        Say you wanted to edit this path to add the following edges in blue:
        .. image:: /img/exampleGraphPath2.png
        
        First, you need to get the step handles corresponding to `n6` and `n7`, and then insert the new nodes to the path with :func:`odgi.graph.insert_step`. *Note that if you had saved the step handles during path creation, it would not be necessary to traverse the path at this step. Decide which objects to save in memory depending on your application*
        .. code-block:: python
                step = gr.path_begin(path)
                while(gr.get_handle_of_step(step) != n[6]):
                        step = gr.get_next_step(step)
                # now step corresponds to the step handle preceeding our insertion
                next_step = gr.get_next_step(step)
                step = gr.insert_step(step, next_step, n[8]) #1
                step = gr.insert_step(step, next_step, n[5]) #2
                step = gr.insert_step(step, next_step, n[6]) #3
        Each call to :func:`odgi.graph.insert_step` returns the step handle pointing to the inserted node.  
        During the process of amending the path, the graph looks as follows:
        .. figure:: /img/exampleGraphPath.png
                :align: center
                
                Path before additions
        .. figure:: /img/exampleGraphPath3.png
                :align: center
                
                Path after line #1
        .. figure:: /img/exampleGraphPath4.png
                :align: center
                
                Path after line #2
        .. figure:: /img/exampleGraphPath2.png
                :align: center
        
                Path after line #3

*******************************
Saving and Loading ODGI Graphs
*******************************

Graphs can be saved and loaded through the :func:`odgi.graph.serialize` and :func:`odgi.graph.load` methods.  

Graph File Example
==================

If you wish to save the graph from the above session, that can be done with:

.. code-block:: python

        gr.serialize("example_graph.odgi")

This can be loaded into a new python session by using:

.. code-block:: python
        
        gr = odgi.graph()
        gr.load("example_graph.odgi")

Loading in Pre-Existing Data
============================

Provided that data has been serialized in ODGI format, it is possible to read it directly from a file.  Download a `*.odgi file` and load it into python with:

.. code-block:: python
        
        brca2 = odgi.graph()
        brca2.load("cactus-brca2.odgi")

We can poke around this data and get the sequence of the path with:

.. code-block:: python

        path_handle = [] 
        handles = []
        brca2.for_each_path_handle(lambda y: path_handle.append(y))
        brca2.for_each_step_in_path(path_handle[0], 
                lambda y: handles.append(brca2.get_handle_of_step(y)))
        sequence = ""
        for handle in handles:
                sequence += brca2.get_sequence(handle)
        print(sequence)

Reading in a Graph from a Different Format
==========================================

Graph assembies can be created with `VG <https://github.com/vgteam/vg>`_.  Currently the method to convert to odgi format is broken, but graphs can be converted to .json format and subsequently converted to odgi with :download:`this script <../../exdata/jsoner.py>`.
