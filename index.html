        <h3>tools and workflows based on genome variation graphs</h3>
        <p>
          Standard approaches to genome inference and analysis relate sequences to a single linear reference genome.
          This is efficient but has a fundamental problem:
          Differences from this reference are hard to observe and describe in a coherent way.
          Variation and sequence are separated.
        </p>
        <a href="images/genomic-vs-pangenomic-analysis.png"><img src="images/genomic-vs-pangenomic-analysis.png" width="45%"></a>
        <a href="images/genomic-vs-pangenomic-models.png"><img src="images/genomic-vs-pangenomic-models.png" width="54%"></a>
        <p>
          Pangenomic methods allow us to relate all genomes or sequences in our analysis directly to each other.
          Sequence and variation are combined into a coherent data structure.
          This practice is still new, and research into ways to design, implement, and apply this model is ongoing.
          However, there is a growing consensus around best practices.
          Many methods work on an augmented sequence graph model and use a handful of common data formats for input and
          output.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <i>variation graph</i> data model describes the all-to-all alignment of many sequences (genomes or genes for
          instance) as walks through a graph whose nodes are labeled with DNA sequences:

        <p>
          Here, we document tools and workflows that operate on this graphical pangenomic data model.
          Our goal is to provide greater clarity for students and scientists working with this new paradigm for genomic
          research.

        <a href="https://github.com/vgteam/vg"><h2>vg</h2></a>
        The variation graph toolkit <strong><a href="https://github.com/vgteam/vg">vg</a></strong> provides computational methods for creating and manipulating of genome variation graphs. It's pangenome representation of a set of genomes overcomes reference bias and improves read mapping.
        This is highlighted in the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4227">Nature Biotechnology publication</a>.
        Users can receive support on <a href="https://www.biostars.org/t/vg/"><strong>vg</strong>'s Biostars page</a>.

      <div class="w3-third w3-container">
        <a href="https://github.com/vgteam/xg"><h2>xg</h2></a>
        The succinct graph index <strong><a href="https://github.com/vgteam/xg">xg</a></strong> presents a static index of nodes, edges and paths of a variation graph.
        <strong>xg</strong> can be used to annotate graph nodes with their reference path relative positions.
        It was a key component of early development in <strong>vg</strong>, and was use to scale short read mapping to large genomes.
        It implements the <a href="https://github.com/vgteam/libhandlegraph">libhandlegraph</a> API.

        <a href="odgi/index.html"><h2>odgi</h2></a>
        <a href="odgi/index.html"><strong>odgi</strong></a>, the Optimized Dynamic (genome) Graph Interface, links a thrifty dynamic in-memory variation graph data model to a set of algorithms designed for scalable sorting, pruning, transformation, and visualization of very large genome graphs.
        <strong>odgi</strong> includes <a href="odgi/odgipy.html">python bindings</a> that can be used to
        <a href="https://odgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst/tutorial.html">directly interface with its data model.</a>.

        <strong><a href="https://github.com/jltsiren/gbwt">GWBT</a> -</strong> <strong>Graph BWT</strong>
        is a substring index for paths in a <a href="#vg">variation graph</a>.
        It is based on the positional Burrows-Wheeler transform (PBWT) and independently implements its graph extension (gPBWT).
        The <strong>GBWT</strong> supports extreme compression of genome sequences, requiring only 1 bit per 1 kilobasepair of sequence to store a  1000 Genomes Project.
        For documentation see the <a href="https://github.com/jltsiren/gbwt/wiki"><strong>GBWT</strong> wiki</a>.

        <strong><a href="https://github.com/pangenome/spodgi">SpOdgi</a></strong> transforms any 
        <a href="#odgi">odgi</a> genome variation graph file into a SPARQL capable database. 
        The RDF semantics are described in the <a href="https://github.com/vgteam/vg/tree/master/ontology">vg ontology directory</a>.
        This transformation allows us to connect variation graphs to other RDF resources, supporting their query using logic programming.
        Many operations or queries that are implemented in custom code in other pangenome tools can be expressed in compact SPARQL queries executed against <strong>SpOdgi</strong>.

        <a href="handlegraph/index.html"><h2>HandleGraph</h2></a>
        Lessons learned when designing algorithms for variation graphs guided the development of the <a href="handlegraph/index.html"><strong>HandleGraph</strong> model</a> and API.
        It formalizes ways of addressing, traversing, and manipulating the fundamental units of variation graphs.
        Implemented in <a href="https://github.com/vgteam/libhandlegraph"><strong>libhandlegraph</strong></a>, this C++ API hierarchy defines a set of capabilities from the simplest: <a href="https://github.com/vgteam/libhandlegraph/blob/master/src/include/handlegraph/handle_graph.hpp">a static bidirected DNA sequence graph</a>, to the most complex: <a href="https://github.com/vgteam/libhandlegraph/blob/master/src/include/handlegraph/mutable_path_deletable_handle_graph.hpp">dynamic graphs with modifiable paths</a>, and covers a number of important capabilities including serialization and positional indexing.

        The alignment to variation graph inducer <a href="https://github.com/ekg/seqwish"><strong>seqwish</strong></a> renders a set of sequences and alignments into the equivalent variation graph.
        It accomplishes this using a number of tricks to reduce its memory footprint while maintaining a high degree of parallelism.
        The result is entirely dependent on the input alignments, which it represents losslessly.
        <strong>seqwish</strong> is generic: it can induce variation graphs from a collection of human genomes, or a set of noisy nanopore reads.
